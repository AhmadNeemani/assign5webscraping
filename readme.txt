Our analysis began by ensuring data quality with no missing values across all columns, and computing descriptive statistics for key numeric fields (price, original_price, and discount_percentage). We found that prices averaged \$259.46 (median \$193.48, ranging from \$8.88 to \$1099.0), and discount percentages averaged 15.58% (with a median of 0% and a maximum of 77.22%); the top 5 deals ranged from 64.41% to 77.22% discount. Notably, all 91 listings had "Shipping info unavailable" and were posted at hour 19. Challenges include the lack of shipping details and limited temporal variation, suggesting future improvements should focus on enhancing shipping data and broadening the dataset to cover multiple posting hours.
